# splashFall22
Designed this code for Stanford SPLASH.

Goal was CT scan math demonstration.
Focused on abstract understanding of the Fourier Transform to support a workshop on deriving the process through which 1-dimensional projections from various angles are combined to derive the 2-dimensional CT scan cross-section of the subject.
